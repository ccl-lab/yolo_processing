# ROI GUI TOOL

This tools allows you to code ROI objects. It was built specifically for the toys objects from the toy room experiment and needs to be changed for other objects.
The tool provides a MATLAB-based alternative to the current coding tool. It was briefly used during the collection of the toy room data.

## Running the Program

1. Navigate to this directory in MATLAB
2. Enter: **ROI_GUI** and hit enter.
3. Alternatively, you can enter **ROI_GUI('your name')**, which will append 'your name' to the data file that this coding tool will produce.
4. Click on the "load subject", and load a subject directory (e.g. "demo_subject")
5. Use the program to annotate the current ROI (highlighted in green).
6. Data is save automatically as a MATLAB file. It is saved in the same directory as the subject directory (e.g. "demo subject")
